Orchestration & Decision Engine

Purpose:
- Implement workflow orchestration and decision logic (this is the blue box in the diagram).
- Implementations may use n8n, LangGraph, or a custom scheduler.

Conventions:
- Place flow definitions and adapters here.
- Provide a simple Python runner for local testing.
